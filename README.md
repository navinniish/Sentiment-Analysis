TF-IDF (TfidfVectorizer): The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach
assigns a weight to each term based on its frequency in the document and inverse frequency 
across all documents. The TfidfVectorizer from Scikit-learn can convert text into a matrix of TF-IDF features.

The TF-IDF value of a term is determined by two components:

Term Frequency (TF): It represents the frequency of a term within a document. The intuition behind TF is that the more frequent a term is in a document, the more important it is to that document. TF can be calculated using different formulas, but the most common approach is to count the number of occurrences of a term within a document.

Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): It measures the importance of a term in the entire corpus. IDF diminishes the weight of terms that appear in many documents because they are considered less informative. IDF is calculated by taking the total number of documents in the corpus and dividing it by the number of documents that contain the term. The resulting value is then logarithmically scaled to reduce the impact of very common terms.

The TF-IDF value is obtained by multiplying the TF value of a term in a document by the IDF value of that term in the corpus. This process assigns a higher weight to terms that are frequent within a specific document but rare across the entire corpus, indicating their relative importance.

TF-IDF is commonly used for various NLP tasks, including document classification, information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and text clustering. It helps in identifying important keywords or features in a document and distinguishing them from commonly occurring terms.

In practice, libraries like Scikit-learn in Python provide implementations of TF-IDF vectorization, which converts a collection of text documents into a matrix representation of TF-IDF features. This matrix can then be used as input for machine learning algorithms or other text analysis techniques.
